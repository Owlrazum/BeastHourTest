# Test task for Beast Hour studio.

## Description

Was made in two weeks with no pripor knowledge of Mirror and basic understanding of multiplayer games.
Generally, despite Mirror's popularity, I have found it not very convenient to use in terms of how its API is structured.

## Task result

Was not accepted to the vacancy, with reason: "A more quality code was needed, with theoretical knowledge shown in survey used."
